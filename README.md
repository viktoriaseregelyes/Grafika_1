# Computer Graphics (VIIIAB07) - Molecular Docking Application

## Task description
The "Space" key is always used to create two new molecules, between which a Coulomb force is generated, which moves and rotates the molecules. A molecule is a rigid structure of atoms with a random graph topology. The number of atoms is a random number between 2 and 8. The mass of the constituent atoms is an integer multiple of the mass of the hydrogen atom and the charge is an integer multiple of the charge of the electron. The total charge of all molecules is zero. The molecules move in 2D Euclidean space, the atoms here are circular, the graphs within the atom are white and in Euclidean geometry they are sections. Positively charged atoms are red, negatively charged atoms are blue, with intensity proportional to charge. Our microscope maps the Euclidean plane to the hyperbolic plane, preserving the x, y coordinates, and then displays it using the Beltrami-Poincar√© mapping on a circle of maximum radius that can be drawn on a 600x600 resolution screen. The s, d, x, e keys can be used to shift the Euclidean virtual world left, right, down and up by 0.1 units. The time step can be 0.01 sec regardless of the drawing speed.
